## Integrations

Next.js Commerce integrates out-of-the-box with BigCommerce, Shopify, Swell, Saleor, Vendure, Spree and Commerce.js. We plan to support all major ecommerce backends.

## Considerations

- `packages/commerce` contains all types, helpers and functions to be used as base to build a new **provider**.
- **Providers** live under `packages`'s root folder and they will extend Next.js Commerce types and functionality (`packages/commerce`).
- We have a **Features API** to ensure feature parity between the UI and the Provider. The UI should update accordingly and no extra code should be bundled. All extra configuration for features will live under `features` in `commerce.config.json` and if needed it can also be accessed programatically.
- Each **provider** should add its corresponding `next.config.js` and `commerce.config.json` adding specific data related to the provider. For example in case of BigCommerce, the images CDN and additional API routes.

## Configuration

### How to change providers

Open `site/.env.local` and change the value of `COMMERCE_PROVIDER` to the provider you would like to use, then set the environment variables for that provider (use `site/.env.template` as the base).

The setup for Shopify would look like this for example:

```
COMMERCE_PROVIDER=@vercel/commerce-shopify
NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_ACCESS_TOKEN=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN=xxxxxxx.myshopify.com
```

### Features

Every provider defines the features that it supports under `packages/{provider}/src/commerce.config.json`

#### Features Available

The following features can be enabled or disabled. This means that the UI will remove all code related to the feature.
For example: Turning `cart` off will disable Cart capabilities.

- cart
- search
- wishlist
- customerAuth
- customCheckout

#### How to turn Features on and off

> NOTE: The selected provider should support the feature that you are toggling. (This means that you can't turn wishlist on if the provider doesn't support this functionality out the box)

- Open `site/commerce.config.json`
- You'll see a config file like this:
  ```json
  {
    "features": {
      "wishlist": false,
      "customCheckout": true
    }
  }
  ```
- Turn `wishlist` on by setting `wishlist` to `true`.
- Run the app and the wishlist functionality should be back on.

### How to create a new provider

Follow our docs for [Adding a new Commerce Provider](packages/commerce/new-provider.md).

If you succeeded building a provider, submit a PR with a valid demo and we'll review it asap.

## Troubleshoot

<details>
<summary>I already own a BigCommerce store. What should I do?</summary>
<br>
First thing you do is: <b>set your environment variables</b>
<br>
<br>
.env.local

```sh
BIGCOMMERCE_STOREFRONT_API_URL=<>
BIGCOMMERCE_STOREFRONT_API_TOKEN=<>
BIGCOMMERCE_STORE_API_URL=<>
BIGCOMMERCE_STORE_API_TOKEN=<>
BIGCOMMERCE_STORE_API_CLIENT_ID=<>
BIGCOMMERCE_CHANNEL_ID=<>
```

1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Link local instance with Vercel and Github accounts (creates .vercel file): `vercel link`
3. Download your environment variables: `vercel env pull .env.local`

Next, you're free to customize the starter. More updates coming soon. Stay tuned..

```

The error usually occurs when running yarn dev inside of the `/site/` folder after installing a fresh repository.

In order to fix this, run `yarn dev` in the monorepo root folder first.

> Using `yarn dev` from the root is recommended for developing, which will run watch mode on all packages.
